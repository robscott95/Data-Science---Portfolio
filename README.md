# Data Science Portfolio

My portfolio of Data Science Projects

Latest addition - exploration of handling imbalanced datasets in ML using Kaggle's [Credit Card Fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

Currently exploring Bayesian data analysis. Please note that it is not by any means "production" level code. It's simply meant for exploration and deepening of my knowledge.
